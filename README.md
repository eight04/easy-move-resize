easy-move-resize
================

An AutoHotkey script to get Linux-style window dragging and resizing.

- `Alt + Left Click` to move.
- `Alt + Middle Click` to resize. Resize drags the nearest corner of the window.

To change the keybindings, just update the key expresions according to the
AutoHotkey docs (see http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm). If you change
the mouse buttons, remember to update the references at the top of the loops.

Script is based on the following:
- http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/scripts/EasyWindowDrag.htm
- http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/scripts/EasyWindowDrag_(KDE).htm
